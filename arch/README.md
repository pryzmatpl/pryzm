# Architecture Documentation and Systemic Tests

This directory contains architecture documentation and systemic test scripts used to understand the codebase.

## Architecture Documentation

- **TIME_STEP_DIAGRAM.md** - Sequence diagrams showing the flow of user interactions, tool calls, and LLM communication
- **WIRE_DIAGRAM.md** - Architectural component diagrams showing system structure and relationships
- **VOID_CODEBASE_GUIDE.md** - Guide to understanding the Void codebase structure
- **AI_AGENT_PROMPT.md** - Documentation about the AI agent implementation
- **SCREENSHOT_OCR_FEATURE_PROMPT.md** - Implementation guide for screenshot OCR feature
- **TOOL_USE_FIX_PROMPT.md** - Documentation about tool use fixes

## Systemic Tests

These are temporary scripts created to understand specific aspects of the codebase:

- **test_path_resolution.cjs** - Tests for path resolution logic used in toolsService
- **test_tool_call.cjs** - Tests for tool call parsing and extraction
- **test_tool_call.js** - Additional tool call testing utilities

These scripts are not part of the main test suite but were created during development to understand and validate codebase behavior.
